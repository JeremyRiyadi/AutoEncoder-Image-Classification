# Autoencoder-Kirmizi-Image-Classification

This project demonstrates the use of **Autoencoders** for classifying images containing the label *Kirmizi*. The dataset consists of **1074 images**, and the model is trained to identify and classify the *Kirmizi* part of each image

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: To classify the *Kirmizi* region in images using an autoencoder-based model.  
- **Dataset**: 1074 labeled images of *Kirmizi*.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Data preprocessing and normalization.  
  - Building a baseline autoencoder model.  
  - Training and evaluation of the model on the dataset.  
  - Performance measurement using accuracy and **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure)** to evaluate reconstruction quality.
